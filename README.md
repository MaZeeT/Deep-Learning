# Big Data and Business Intelligence
This is my submission of the "Big Data and Business Intelligence" course exam project from RUC (Roskilde University).
A description of the course can be found in CourseDescription.pdf

The submission is consist of the notebooks, BaselineConvNN, BaselineDense, PrimingConvNN, and PrimingDense, where I see the effect of priming the network by training for many iterations on a subset of the training set, before training with the full set.
